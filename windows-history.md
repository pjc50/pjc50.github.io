To me it's more:

Stone Age (1985): Windows is a single-user graphical shell for the PC that is necessarily very close to the hardware.

Bronze Age (1993): Windows NT is launched as a multi-user *secure* applications platform. Hardware access is no longer direct. This is sold almost exclusively to businesses.

Iron Age (late 90s): "Hardware" is no longer fixed at boot. Computers are no longer islands. Users expect TCP/IP networking built in. USB arrives round about Win95OSR2 and complicates everything. Security problems start to matter. Windows acquires a rounded, "friendly" skin and the cheerful rolling hills of the default background.

Steel Age (2006): the security problems become untenable. Downloading anything from the internet is extremely risky. A decision is made to kill the "stone age" line of compatibility; everything derives from NT now, and the normal logged in user is no longer "root" all the time. UAC appears to guard the user against malicious executables.

Tablet Age (2012): the iPad is eating their lunch. Microsoft panics. Having had a tablet OS for ages that never took off outside of niches (Windows CE), they decide that Windows will be relaunched as a tablet-first OS with everything written in C# using their new flat graphic design style. The 99% of desktop users are disoriented by the tablet-first design. Windows phones are launched, then the burning platform sinks below the waves again, taking Nokia with it. Pity, the Nokia Lumia 1040 was an amazing phone.

Final Form (present): Microsoft go to version 10 then promise to stay there forever. Updates are now continuous and rolling. They've mostly backed off the tablet interface .. but never really finished the modernisation.
